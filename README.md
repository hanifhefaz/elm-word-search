# elm-word-search

This package is used to search for words in multiple documents.


## example

your search query for this string: `I want to play football in the morning`

and your documents include multiple sentences like:

`I like to play football with my friend`

`He is not able to play football in the morning`

The result you get will be `He is not able to play footbal in the morning` since it contains multiple words that match the search query.
